# system_utilities
Repo for system utilities 

I am a system admin, with a little experience in development. But I like development, especially Python. 

Most of the created new issues in this project are only for my self practice, to be able develop advanced system. And they may not be much useful in real world, as many such utilities already exist.

You too can join to collaborate and share ideas to achieve any set goals.
